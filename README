eutester version 0.0.1
=====================

eutester is an attempt to leverage existing test code to make test writing faster and standardized.

Design:
Eutester is designed to allow a user to quickly generate automated tests for testing a Eucalyptus cloud. There is a configuration file
associated with the library that describes a few things about the clouds configuration including the bare metal machine configuration and IPs.

The configuration file has the following structure:
<ip or hostname>    CENTOS  5.7 64  REPO    [CC00 CLC SC00 WS]
<ip or hostname>    VMWARE  ESX-4.0 64  REPO    [NC00]
<ip or hostname>    VMWARE  ESXI-4.1    64  REPO    [NC00]

Columns:
    1. IP or hostname of machine
    2. Distro installed on machine
    3. Distro version on machine
    4. Distro base architecture
    5. List of components installed on this machine encapsulated in brackets []
        - These components can be: 
            a. CLC - Cloud Controller
            b. WS - Walrus
            c. SC00 - Storage controller for cluster 00
            d. CC00 - Cluster controller for cluster 00
            e. NC00 - A node controller in cluster 00

The basic constructor will:
    1. Connect to the machine denoted as CLC in the cloud.conf
    2. Pull down credentials from the CLC if the credpath has not been provided
    3. Setup boto connections to both ec2 and walrus on the cloud
    4. Leave the SSH connection to the CLC up for further use

SAMPLE FIRST SCRIPT

from eutester import eutester
if __name__ == '__main__':
    clc_session = eutester.eutester( credpath="eucarc-eucalyptus-admin", password="foobar")
    ### ACCESS THE CONNECTION TO EC2
    print clc_session.ec2.get_all_images()
    ### ACCESS THE CONNECTION TO WALRUS
    print clc_session.walrus.get_all_buckets()
    ### ACCESS THE SSH SESSION TO THE CLC
    print clc_session.sys("free")
    clc_session.do_exit()
